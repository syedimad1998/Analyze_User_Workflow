In today's shopping world, choices are like snacks at a party â€“ plenty to pick from! If folks aren't loving what you're offering, they'll just hop to the next virtual aisle. To keep your customers in the groove, it's all about making them happy and keeping them loyal. Think of it like having a cool playlist for your online store!

Creating an e-commerce site isn't just about what customers need right now. It's about making them say, "Wow, this is my favorite store!" We want them to stick around like a catchy tune you can't get out of your head. So, let's make sure our online shop is the hit of the shopping charts! ðŸŽ¶

I made a website that's like Shopify to try some things out. You can find lots of easy guides on making your own online store. No need for tricky coding stuff! The main idea is to make the website work better for people â€“ like a smoother ride for users. Let's keep it simple and fun! ðŸŒŸ

The Website walkthrough is guided by walk me application which guides the user through various steps on the page. Again you can refer to tons of resources online to embed the walk-through logic. We will embed this at last after we analyze the pages that show a pattern of user's navigating throughout the website.
